(1) insert the sd card in the pc or laptop
(2) Find balena etcher in this folder and pick the version
(3) open balena etcher put this link in it https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images/raspios_arm64-2020-05-28/2020-05-27-raspios-buster-arm64.zip
(4) then in balena etcher wait for the second and pick the sd card
(5) then press flash and wait until it is turned on
(6) Then remove the sd card and put it in the pitop pc
(7) then follow the instructions below and do not turn on the pi until everything is completed

                                                              WHAT ARE THESE ADDONS FOR **********

(1) A PC rack is used for organizing the components of a desktop pc in one place allowing you to have a neat environment.
It is also handy because pitop is known for slowing down if the motherboard is getting way too hot. 

(2) A SSD is a Harddrive for pitop which is recommended because it gives much more space at higher speeds. They can speed up
the R/W operation on the pitop. Also SD cards and especially micro SD cards are known to wear down after only 100 R/W operations which could cause the SD card to fail after 1-2 years of regular usage. SSD can give you over 10000 R/W operations which means it will work for over 10-20 years of regular usage. They also use less electricity because they do not have moving parts like traditional harddrives do.

(3) A battery is needed for NON-PLUG operation in case electricity is suddenly taken down. It can also power most of the addons needed for this pitop pc. This is not really needed at all for proper operation of the pitop pc.

(4) The desktop display is needed because the screen provided is not big enough to read or write fast and efficently. It also can lower the amount of bluelight radiation.

(5) A carrying case is needed for those who don't want to spend money on a laptop but need a portable pc. You can carry the pitop,mouse,keyboard,mini screen and much more. You could also include a battery pack listed in number 3 for even more portability. Pitop weighs only 2.38 pounds which means it will be really lightweight. Pitop is also easy to connect and takes up only 2 min for assembly. The case also gives protection against water,high and low temperature and physical damage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               
        DO NOT USE A NON-OFFICAL MOTHERBOARD MODEL IN THIS KIT!
        DO NOT STICK FINGERS IN THE COOLING FAN!
        DO NOT USE ALCOHOL BASED PRODUCTS ON THE INSIDE PARTS AND CONTACTS.
        TO CLEAN USE A DAMP TOWEL TO CLEAN ONLY THE CASE.
        YOU MUST PUT THE MICRO SD CARD AND AN OPTIONAL SSD DRIVE INSIDE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WON'T BOOT WITHOUT IT.
        THE TEMPATURE SHOULD BE  30-120 DEGREES OR ELSE PITOP PREFORMANCE WILL BE TROTTLED TO LOW SPEED.

                                      Comparison of a normal desktop pc and PItop desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The normal desktop uses almost 5 times more electricity in WATTS than the pitop desktop which means the pitop can save your electricity bills.

(2) Both the normal desktop and PItop pc can handle 1084px videos and heavy duty games.

(3) The normal desktop boots 20 seconds slower than a PItop desktop

(4) The PItop desktop CPU and Z-RAM usage is more efficient than a normal desktop due to LZ cache commpression.

(5) Both PItop desktop and normal desktop can open about 21 chrome tabs, 1 GIMP window ,2 terminal tabs and 1 local HD video.

(6) PItop is faster than a normal desktop when a SSD is used.

(7) Internal hardware can be easily connected to PItop desktop.

(8) Both normal and PItop desktop can support LUKS ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION at the highest level.

(9) Both CPU and GPU of the PItop can be overclocked by 50% while normal desktop can only overclock to 20%.
