        <h3>Fused with linux mint-debian and steam runtime engine<br>this makes this os ideal for making a portable usb capable of fast gaming and streaming.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Unfortunately this site was not updated since 3/07/2018</h3>
        <p>But you can still install the system image because it still works on most laptops and desktop computers</p>
        <p>it also works on portable lattepanda hardware made for gaming. - lattapanda hardware <a onclick="window.location.href='https://www.lattepanda.com/products/lattepanda-alpha-864s.html'" target="_blank">LINK</a>  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This system was made way back in 2017 by Shamil Burkhanov for minecraft and call of duty gaming.</p>
        <p>He focused on making sure the system was not large like windows and could work even on old computers without losing out on gaming preformance.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>to use this system you can download a img flasher like balenaetcher and flash the image to a flash drive or sd card with 20GB storage or more.Than you need to dual boot to the flash drive like on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzd73vS9WXo</p>
        <br>

        <p>here is the usage video</p>

        <h3>Copatability</h3>
        <p>i tested this system on hp pavilion 164,lenovo s145 laptop and a dell desktop.I think it should work as long as you fullfill the following requirements</p>

        <h3>TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>
        <br>
        <h5>system says that i am running in fallback mode what should i do?</h5>
        <p>I would reccommend reverting all of the updates recently done and restart the pc.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>I get a message that the image is not verified when i try to boot to the usb what should i do?</h5>
        <p>make sure secure boot is off and that the compatability is for uefi</p>
